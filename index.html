    I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Parietal team (Inria) working in Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML) and neurosciences. My previous work as a PhD candidate at Inria (Commands team) was more focused in the interface between control, machine learning and optimization.

    In between these two academic positions, I worked in the industry in the speech processing field. As a scientific and engineering AI lead at Ava, I did my best to help making a more accessible world.
