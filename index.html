    Passionate about machine learning research in general and its applications for the common good.
</p>
<p>
    I am a research scientist at <a class="url" href="https://ptrckprz.github.io/valeoai/">Valeo.ai</a>, working in deep learning for automotive applications.
    My work mostly revolves around the idea of learning and exploiting data symmetries (invariances and equivariances) to make neural networks more data efficient and robust.
    You can find more details about my research and professional journey in the <a class="url" href="about">About</a> section or in my most recent <a class="url" href="publications">papers</a>.
