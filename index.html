    Passionate about machine learning research in general and its applications for the common good.

<p>
    I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Parietal team (Inria) working in deep learning and neuroscience. My previous work as a PhD candidate at Inria (Commands team) was focused on interpretable and physically-plausible learning, in the context of data-driven control and model-based reinforcement learning.

    In between these two academic positions, I worked for two years in a start-up called Ava as the scientific and engineering leader of their AI team. I did my best there to help making a more accessible world by developping innotivative speech processing technology for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
