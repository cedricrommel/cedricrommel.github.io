    Passionate about machine learning research in general and its applications for the common good.
</p>
<p>
    I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Parietal team (Inria) working in deep learning and computational neuroscience. My previous work as a PhD candidate at Inria (Commands team) was focused on interpretable and physically-plausible learning, in the context of data-driven optimal control.

<p>
    In between these two academic positions, I was the chief scientist and AI lead in a start-up called Ava. I did my best there to help making a more accessible world by developping innotivative real-time speech processing technology for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
