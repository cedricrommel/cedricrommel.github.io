    Passionate about machine learning research in general and its applications for the common good.
</p>
<p>
    I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the <a class="url" href="https://team.inria.fr/parietal/">Parietal team at Inria</a> working at the intersection of deep learning and neuroscience.
    I mostly study data augmentation techniques and, more generally, how to best leverage invariance in neural networks.
    You can find more details about my current research in the <a class="url" href="about.md">About</a> section or in my most recent <a class="url" href="publications.html">papers</a>.

<p>
    Before my postdoc I worked as the scientific and engineering leader of the AI team at <a class="url" href="https://www.ava.me/">Ava</a>, where I helped designing real-time speech processing models for deaf and hard-of-hearing users.
    I obtained my PhD in 2018 from <a class="url" href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">Ã‰cole Polytechnique</a>, after working on offline model-based reinforcement learning with interpretable and physically-plausible models.
