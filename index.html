    Passionate about machine learning research in general and its applications for the common good.
</p>
<p>
    I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Parietal team (Inria) working at the intersection of deep learning and neuroscience. My previous work as a PhD candidate at Inria (Commands team) was focused on interpretable and physically-plausible learning in the context of offline model-based reinforcement learning.

    In between these two academic positions, I worked in real-time speech processing as the scientific and engineering leader of the AI team in a start-up called Ava. I did my best there to help making a more accessible world by developping innotivative speech technology for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
