I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Parietal team](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/) (Inria), working in deep learning and neuroscience. My research currently revolves around the idea of learning and exploiting data invariances to make deep neural networks more data efficient. This includes for example learning optimal data augmentations directly from datasets for which those are not intuitive, such as brain electrical signals. This question is particularly important for applications where labeled data is scarce. Besides helping with sample complexity, leveraging data invariances allows to better generalize out of distribution and also to learn more about where target information is encoded in neurological signals.

Previously, I was the scientific and engineering leader of the AI team at [Ava](https://www.ava.me/), working in speaker recognition technology for deaf and hard-of-hearing accessibility. Me and my team were then mainly focused on real-time speaker recognition and diarization with multiple microphones, which involved works in online sequential models, zero-shot learning and neural architectures for speech processing.

I obtained my PhD in applied mathematics at the [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) ([CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr)) and [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/commands/), under the supervision of [Frédéric Bonnans](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~bonnans/) and [Pierre Martinon](http://www.cmapx.polytechnique.fr/~martinon/). My work lied in the intersection between optimal control, machine learning and optimization, in the spirit of the recently baptized _[learning-to-control](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/l2c-icml2018/)_ subfield of model-based reinforcement learning.
My main interest was to learn interpretable and physically plausible models of dynamical systems, and how to optimally control them within safe boundaries.
As my thesis was funded by the aviation start up [Safety Line](https://www.safety-line.fr/), the concrete application of real aircraft trajectories optimization for fuel and CO2 emissions reduction had a central role in my works.
I am proud that my algorithms are now part of the product [OptiClimb](https://www.sita.aero/solutions/sita-for-aircraft/digital-day-of-operations/opticlimb/), which is currently used daily to compute fuel efficient flights all over the globe.

Before my PhD thesis I studied at [MINES ParisTech](https://www.mines-paristech.fr/) where I obtained a MSc. in engineering and applied mathematics. While there I could intern at the Systems and Control lab ([CAS](http://cas.ensmp.fr/)) under the supervision of [Nicolas Petit](http://cas.ensmp.fr/~petit/) and [Lionel Magnis](http://cas.ensmp.fr/~magnis/).
