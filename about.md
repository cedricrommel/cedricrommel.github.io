![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Parietal team](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/) (INRIA), working in deep learning and neuroscience under the supervision of [Thomas Moreau](https://tommoral.github.io/about.html) and [Alexandre Gramfort](https://alexandre.gramfort.net/). My research currently revolves around the idea of learning and exploiting data invariances to make deep neural networks more data efficient and robust to domain changes. This includes for example learning optimal data augmentations directly from datasets for which those are not intuitive, such as brain electrical signals. I am also interested in using learned invariances as a tool to better understand how some types of information (e.g. sleep stages) are encoded within neurological signals.

Previously, I was the scientific and engineering leader of the AI team at [Ava](https://www.ava.me/), working in speaker recognition technology for deaf and hard-of-hearing accessibility. Me and my team were then mainly focused on real-time speaker recognition and diarization with multiple microphones, which involved works in zero-shot learning, metric learning and neural architectures for speech processing.

I obtained my PhD in applied mathematics at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) ([CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr)) and [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/commands/), under the supervision of [Frédéric Bonnans](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~bonnans/) and [Pierre Martinon](http://www.cmapx.polytechnique.fr/~martinon/). My work lied in the intersection between optimal control, machine learning and optimization. My main interest was to learn interpretable and physically plausible models of dynamical systems, and how to optimally control them taking model uncertainty into account. My thesis was funded by the aviation start up [Safety Line](https://www.safety-line.fr/) and the main application of my work was the optimization of real aircraft trajectories for fuel consumption reduction. My algorithms integrated the product [OptiClimb](https://www.sita.aero/solutions/sita-for-aircraft/digital-day-of-operations/opticlimb/), which is currently used daily to compute fuel efficient flights all over the globe by companies such as AirFrance.

Before my PhD thesis I studied at [MINES ParisTech](https://www.mines-paristech.fr/) where I obtained a MSc. in engineering and applied mathematics.
