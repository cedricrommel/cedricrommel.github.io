I am a machine learning scientist and tech lead of the AI team at [Ava](https://www.ava.me/), working in speaker recognition research to help breaking communication barriers between the deaf & the hearing world. My current research and engineering topics include mainly real-time speaker diarization with multiple channels, metric learning and neural voice embeddings.

I obtained my PhD (CIFRE) in Machine Learning and Optimal Control from the [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), under the supervision of [Frédéric Bonnans](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~bonnans/) and [Pierre Martinon](http://www.cmapx.polytechnique.fr/~martinon/) from INRIA's [COMMANDS team](https://team.inria.fr/commands/). I was also greatly advised by the researchers from the French start up [Safety Line](https://www.safety-line.fr/), which funded my PhD. During my thesis I could develop practical solutions for identifying civil aircraft dynamical models using historical flights data, and use such models to reduce future flights fuel consumption and CO2 emissions with model-based reinforcement learning. My work is now part of the product [OptiClimb](https://www.safety-line.fr/des-solutions-adaptees/opticlimb/), which is currently being used to deliver fuel efficient trajectories for flights all over the globe.

I also hold a MSc. in engineering and applied mathematics from [MINES ParisTech](https://www.mines-paristech.fr/).
