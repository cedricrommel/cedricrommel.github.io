I am a research scientist at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/), working in AI for neural interfaces.

Prior to joining Meta, I worked in deep learning for automotive applications at [Valeo.ai](https://valeoai.github.io/blog/), with a particular emphasis on computer vision and human pose estimation.

Before my time at Valeo, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Inria's [MIND team](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) (previously known as Parietal team). Under the supervision of [Thomas Moreau](https://tommoral.github.io/about.html) and [Alexandre Gramfort](https://alexandre.gramfort.net/), I delved into the intersection of deep learning and neuroscience. My primary research focused on automatic data augmentation, specifically learning optimal data augmentations directly from datasets. I was particularly interested in applications for which data augmentations are not intuitive, such as EEG (electroencephalography), where data augmentations served as a tool to better understand how certain types of information, like sleep stages, are encoded within neurological signals. Over time, my work transitioned into the field of [geometric deep learning](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/), with a focus on learning and exploiting data symmetries to enhance the efficiency and robustness of neural networks.

Before my postdoctoral position, I served as the scientific and engineering leader of the AI team at [Ava](https://www.ava.me/). Our primary focus was on speaker recognition technology for deaf and hard-of-hearing accessibility. My team and I were particularly focused on real-time _speaker diarization_, _i.e._, the difficult task of automatically detecting "who said what when".

I obtained my PhD in applied mathematics from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) ([CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr)) and [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/commands/), under the supervision of [Frédéric Bonnans](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~bonnans/) and [Pierre Martinon](http://www.cmapx.polytechnique.fr/~martinon/). My research centered on the intersection of optimal control, machine learning, and optimization. I focused on developing interpretable and physically plausible models of dynamical systems, and on optimally controlling them while accounting for model uncertainty. My thesis was funded by the aviation startup [Safety Line](https://www.safety-line.fr/) (later acquired by SITA), and the primary application of my work was the optimization of real aircraft trajectories for fuel consumption reduction. The algorithms I developed were integrated into the product [OptiClimb](https://www.sita.aero/solutions/sita-for-aircraft/digital-day-of-operations/opticlimb/), which is currently used daily to compute fuel-efficient flights globally by companies such as AirFrance.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained a MSc. in engineering and applied mathematics from [MINES ParisTech](https://www.mines-paristech.fr/).
