I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Parietal team](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/) (Inria), working in automatic data augmentation methods and neurosciences.

Previously, I was a lead machine learning researcher and engineer at [Ava](https://www.ava.me/), working in speaker recognition technology for deaf and hard-of-hearing accessibility. The main topic I was focused on was real-time speaker diarization with multiple channels, which involves sequential models, representation learning in zero-shot framework and neural architectures for speech processing.

I obtained my PhD in applied mathematics at the [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) ([CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr)) and [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/commands/), under the supervision of [Frédéric Bonnans](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~bonnans/) and [Pierre Martinon](http://www.cmapx.polytechnique.fr/~martinon/). My work lied in the intersection between optimal control, machine learning and optimization, in the spirit of the recently baptized _[learning-to-control](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/l2c-icml2018/)_ subfield of reinforcement learning theory.
As my thesis was funded by the aviation start up [Safety Line](https://www.safety-line.fr/), my ideas were naturally focused on the application of real aircraft trajectories optimization for fuel and CO2 emissions reduction. My work is now part of the product [OptiClimb](https://www.safety-line.fr/des-solutions-adaptees/opticlimb/), which is currently used daily to compute fuel efficient flights all over the globe.

Before my PhD thesis I studied at [MINES ParisTech](https://www.mines-paristech.fr/) where I obtained a MSc. in engineering and applied mathematics. While there I could intern at the Systems and Control lab ([CAS](http://cas.ensmp.fr/)) under the supervision of [Nicolas Petit](http://cas.ensmp.fr/~petit/) and [Lionel Magnis](http://cas.ensmp.fr/~magnis/).
